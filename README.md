# AutoDimGrids

Revit addin to automatically dimension selected grids, aligning the dimension to the top and the left.

Select the orthogonal grids (doesn't work on grids with an angle) you want to dimension and press the button

Doesn't matter if the ends of the grids are aligned or not

2. Unzip all files in your revit addins folder

Normally, this will be the folder. You need to choose your Revit version here

Finally you will need to unblock the DLLs in order to use the addin*

*These files are not malicious but Windows will block these types of downloads for safety. You can review all code and even build it yourself if that's something you fancy.
